============================================

This document contains actual questions asked by the users and might be
updated from time to time.


1. BAM
------

Q: What does an "invalid BAM" mean?

A: On a 1541 disk, the BAM (block availability map) stores which sectors (or
   blocks) are used by files and which are available. It also stores the
   number of available blocks per track.

   When V1541Commander opens a disk, it tries to read a CBM DOS filesystem
   from it and doing this, the BAM is validated. First, it is checked whether
   the available blocks per track actually match the BAM data. It is also
   acceptable if this number is 0 for *all* tracks, because there are disks
   using this to report a fake "0 blocks free." line.

   Then, the BAM data is compared to the blocks actually used by the
   directory and files found on the disk. This check will fail if there are
   things on the disk V1541Commander doesn't know, like for example
   trackloaders, C128 boot sectors, GEOS files, etc.

   When the BAM is found to be invalid, V1541Commander suggests to treat the
   image as a "new" image, so you don't accidentally overwrite your original
   image when saving after making some changes.


Q: What happens when I edit a disk with an "invalid BAM"?

A: This depends on how the BAM is invalid. If there are some additional blocks
   marked as used, you just can't use these when writing files. If some blocks
   actually used by files are marked "available", writing files to this disk
   *could* overwrite these blocks, destroying other files.

   It's probably best to save your edited disk as a new image and thoroughly
   test it.


Q: How can I fix an "invalid BAM"?

A: Use "rewrite image" from the "CBM DOS" menu. But be warned that this
   creates a new disk image from the current filesystem. Any data
   V1541Commander doesn't understand (like trackloaders, C128 boot sectors,
   etc) will be missing on the disk after rewriting the image.


2. Broken filesystem and recovery mode
--------------------------------------

Q: What is a broken filesystem?

A: A filesystem stored on a 1541 disk can have some severe consistency
   problems. A typical problem would be a sector that is used twice (e.g.
   by the directory and a file, or by two different files). If such a problem
   is found, V1541Commander tells you the filesystem is broken and will be
   opened in recovery mode. The default action is to rewrite the image
   directly after opening, so you have a clean image with the data that could
   be recovered, but you can disable this.


Q: What does open in recovery mode mean?

A: Recovery mode is automatically used to open a filesystem from a disk image
   when severe problems with the filesystem are found. In recovery mode,
   V1541Commander tries to read as much file data as possible, while avoiding
   to read a sector twice. There is no guarantee that everything can be read.


Q: Can I edit a broken filesystem?

A: Short answer: no. A broken filesystem will be read-only. But you can copy
   files from it to another disk image or to your file manager using
   drag&drop. Of course, you can rewrite the disk image to get a new, clean
   image from whatever was successfully read, and then you can fully edit
   the image. Be aware you might lose data doing this.


Q: I downloaded a Zipcode compressed disk and V1541Commander tells me it has
   a broken filesystem, what should I do?

A: In most cases, your download is probably fine. Even a broken filesystem
   *could* work flawlessly for reading on a 1541 drive. To save the extracted
   image without any changes, do the following:
   - In the options dialog popping up, uncheck the checkbox saying to rewrite
     the image after recovery.
   - Then, save the disk from the file menu (or by hitting Ctrl+S).
   - Answer yes to the safety question asking you whether you really want to
     save an image with a broken filesystem.
   This process will save the exact image that was found in the Zipcode files.
